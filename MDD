Setting autocontour: true and using a smaller delX and delY value helps with minimizing the prominence of theta discontinuity (for streamfunction value for source flows and for potential function for free vortex flows) on the x-axis rather than trying to manually control the contour parameters.
All phase unwrapping attempts I've made have failed miserably.
Someone needs to write an actual manual for Plotly.js. Seriously, do they expect us to just figure it out by trial and error? Spent like half a day figuring out marker rotations for arrowheads for velocity.
